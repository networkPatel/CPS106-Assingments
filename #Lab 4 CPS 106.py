#1. what is luminance? the brightness of a color
#2. Why is the maximum value for any color component 255? 8 bits is 1 byte 0-255 represents the 256 magnitude
#3. The color encoding weâ€™re using is RGB. What does this mean, in terms of the amount of memory required to represent color? Is there a limit to the number of colors that we can represent? Are there enough colors representable in RGB?
#RPG file is RBG-24 bit file as JPG is already a pretty compressed file the RAM is used efficiently 256^3 different colors you could select from
